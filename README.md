# Drowsiness_Driver_detection

The Drowsiness Driver Detection System is a software application that monitors a driver's alertness using facial landmarks by Harcascad algorithm. When a driver shows signs of drowsiness, such as heavy eyelids or reduced eye blink frequency, the system triggers an alert to prevent accidents caused by driver fatigue.


## Features

- Real-time drowsiness detection using a webcam feed.
- Sound alerts to notify the driver when drowsiness is detected.
- Face detection and tracking for improved accuracy.
- Easy-to-customize thresholds and parameters.
- Minimal resource consumption.

  ## Requirements

- Python (3.x )
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- imutils
- dlib
- Pygame (for sound alerts)
